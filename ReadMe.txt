LIFELINE SHOW CONTROL V.2.0 - TED CHARLES BROWN - TEDCHARLESBROWN.COM

---ABOUT THIS APPLICATION---
On shows I would find I would be constantly opening up the command prompt in order to ping different computers.
Instead of doing that, I made this program in order to ping multiple addresses at once while not looking like a hacker with 10 command prompts open at once.
This is accomplished by using java and the java.net library.

---HOW TO USE APPLICATION--
1. Open the settings.txt file.
2. DO NOT CHANGE FORMATTING, EMPTY TARGETS MUST SAY "empty"
3. Default Ping Time = 5 seconds. Change timing at first row
4. Assign names to ping targets: "Name # =" (Name Goes Here)
5. Assign IPs to ping targets: "IP # =" (IP Goes Here)

Note: Ping targets do not need names, but need valid IP addresses to work.
If program's frame rate goes below 10 fps, this may cause issues - the blue lines will turn red to denote.

---DISCLAIMER---
1. PINGING A COMPUTER DOES NOT ALWAYS INDICATE THE COMPUTER'S HEALTH. THE COMPUTER MAY BE NON-RESPONSIVE BUT STILL RETURN A PING.
THIS IS TRUE EVEN WHEN PINGING THROUGH A COMMAND PROMPT.
2. PING TIME OF 0 SECONDS WILL PING INDEFINITELY, BUT CAN CAUSE PING TARGETS TO RETURN FALSE NEGATIVE RESPONSES.

---BUGS OR COMMENTS?---
Found one of the many bugs I am sure are in this?... Have a comment on how this could work better for you? Want to say hi or buy me a pizza?
